                        Living with roommates can sometimes be a hassle.
                        Dividing up chores can be tough when it's so easy to forget who does what and when.
                        There are many ways to handle this manually, but often it's hard to keep track of everything and stay consistent.
                        Keeping consistent is key in keeping clean living spaces and a fair distribution of chores.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Enter Roomley, an app that handles the annoying task of keeping track of tasks to get done.
                        Roomley handles reminders, grocery shopping together, and hopefully splitting bills easily.
