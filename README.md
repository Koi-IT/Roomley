# Andrew Johnson Roomley Project

## Problem Statement

Living with roommates can sometimes be a hassle. Dividing up chores can be tough when its so easy to forget who does what and when.
There are many ways to handle this manually but often its hard to keep track of everything and stay consistent.
Keeping consistent is key in keeping clean living spaces and a fair distribution of chores.

Enter Roomley, an app that handles the annoying task of keeping track of tasks to get done.
Roomley handles reminders, grocery shopping together, and hopefully splitting bills easily.

## Main Features

1. Ability to fairly assign tasks weekly
2. Notifications that are sent out at set intervals to each member of the group
3. Ability to create lists (grocery lists etc) collaboratively
4. Ability to attach context to each task
5. *Ability to easily find bills to split via plaid* (If this is possible)
